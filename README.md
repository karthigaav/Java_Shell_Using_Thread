# Java_Shell_Using_Thread

<b>Project Introduction:</b>
<p>This program is an Extension of interactive shell application implemented using Threads in Java language. The accomplishment is to provide a user a command promt and prompt the user for a operating system commands such as: attrib, copy, delete, dir, execute, main, mkdir, date, time, edit, rename, rmdir. This is same output like my @Java_Shell_Program but the only variation is this interactive shell program is implemented using Java Threads i.e each class is implemented using threads.</p></br>
<b>Implementation Of Each Class:</b></br>
<ul><li>Attrib.java - This class has a method that is implemented to make a file read only.</li>
<li>Copy.java - the command copy fileA fileB will copy fileA to fileB.</li>
<li>Delete.java - This is implemented to delete a file.</li>
<li>Dir.java - This is implement to list the directory name that is displayed. In case of just dir, the list of the items in the current directory should show up.</li>
<li>execute.java - This class is implemented to run the main class as a command through this execute class.</li>
<li>mkdir name - mkdir.java - This class is implemented to create a directory.</li>
<li>MyDate.java - This class is for displaying the current time.</li>
<li>Notepad.java - This is a edit class that displays a notepad editor on the screen</li>
<li>Rename.java - Rename fileA to fileB.</li>
<li>Rmdir.java- This class is to remove the directory that is given as a input in the command prompt.</li>
<li>main.java - This class will have all the other classes has objects on its main method.</li></ul>

<b>NOTE:</b>
<p>Most of these commands the user types a path and a name. For example if the user types: <b>dir C:\windows</b>
The files and the directories of the directory windows must show up.</p>

<b>Software Requirements:</b>
<p>Used Eclipse Editor for Coding and testing.</p>

<b>System Requirements:</b>
<p>I have used Windows Operating system but this Application can be used in MAC, Linux too.</p>

<b>Programming Language:</b>
<p>core Java - Threads & Advance Java Libraries.</p>

<b>How to execute this project:</b>
<p>dowload all the .java files and put all the file into a zip file. Then import this folder to a Eclipse IDE editor and then execute the Execute.java file first. finaly, enter the command in the command prompt as assisted above.</p>

<b>Conclusion:</b>
<p>This programming implementation directly interacts with kernel level of the operating systems and complete each task.</p>
